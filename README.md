# flood_alert_app
This project is a smart flood prediction and alert system that uses real-time weather data and historical flood records to predict the chances of a flood occurring. It is built using Python and Streamlit for the user interface, OpenWeatherMap API for live weather data, and a machine learning model (Logistic Regression) for flood prediction.
